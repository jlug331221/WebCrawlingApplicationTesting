# WebCrawlingApplicationTesting

### Web crawling based testing

We show that web crawling based testing is application specific. Testers have to manually configure the webcrawler for each web application
and then they can perform test case generation.

**web-crawler.py** is a sample of a crawler program that extracts features from a web form

**web-crawler-config.yaml** is the configuration file for web-crawler config. We can see that this config is application specific.


*How do we enhance web crawling based technique to adapt multiple web applications?*
